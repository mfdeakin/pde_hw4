\begin{enumerate}
\item Show that $W^{1, 2}(\reals^N) \subset L^2(\reals^N)$ is not compact.

\item Let $n > 4$
  Show that the embedding $W^{2, 2}(\domain) \rightarrow L^{\frac{2 n}{n - 4}}(\domain)$ is not compact.

\item Describe the embedding of $W^{3, p}(\domain)$ in different dimensions.
  State if the embedding is continuous or compact.
